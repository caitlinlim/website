                 <h3 class="extra_1_subheading">| HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
                 <p>Web development has always been a facet of technology that has piqued my interest. 
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to focus on developing skills that would 
                    allow me to build and design my own personal website, through which I could showcase 
                    my extracurriculars, work experience, and side projects. </p>
                <p>As such, I began researching front-end development and subsequently came across an online 
                    course hosted by Code with Mosh that could teach me how to build my own website on the IDE 
                    Visual Studio Code, utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Ultimately, I was educated on 
                    web development principles, HTML/CSS basics, layout, typography, images, forms, transitions, 
                    animations, etc. </p>
                <p>The website you are currently viewing is the fruit of my labour! Of course, it is a work in 
                    progress, and I will be gradually adding new features and updating information as time goes on. 
                    Throughout the course of my computer science degree, this is one of the most rewarding projects 
                    I have had the pleasure of working on. </p>

                <h2 class="extra_2_heading">Automate Spotify</h2>
                <h3 class="extra_2_subheading">| Python</h3>
                <p>Python was the main language that facilitated my transition into coding comfortably and 
                    paved the way for the first side project I decided to complete in my spare time. </p> 
                <p>Two of the most popular online platforms I utilize daily are YouTube and Spotify. Whenever 
                    I come across a new song on YouTube, I always try to search for it on Spotify to add to one 
                    of my playlists. Therefore, I wanted to see if I could build an application that could 
                    automatically generate a playlist in Spotify populated with liked songs from YouTube. </p>   
                <p>During my research on the Internet, I came across a tutorial that showed how to design such an 
                    application on the IDE PyCharm, utilizing YouTube Data API, Spotify Web API, youtube_dl, and 
                    Python Requests Library. Ultimately, this was my first insight into the world of real-life applications. 
                    Up until this point, I had only ever utilized Python for building very simple functions that had no 
                    purpose in my daily life. As such, this project was a huge turning point in my coding journey and a 
                    major eye-opener that allowed me to understand that Python could be utilized to build programs that 
                    are complex, practical, and useful.</p>
                <p>The YouTube Data API was used to retrieve the list of videos liked by the user authorizing the 
                    API request. The Spotify Web API was employed to create a new playlist, search for items, and 
                    add items to the playlist, using an OAuth token and Spotify username. The youtube_dl library 
                    was utilized to determine the artistâ€™s name and the track name, instead of parsing through all 
                    the information manually. Finally, Python Requests library was employed allowed me to make 
                    requests to the two aforementioned APIs. Furthermore, this was also my first real exposure into 
                    how JSON-format data is generated and parsed through.  </p>
                <p>As with any side project, there are still many improvements that can be made. Currently, I am in 
                    the midst of figuring out how I can add disliked videos to a playlist, as well as create playlists 
                    for specific genres of songs. Ultimately, I hope to implement all the principles I learned throughout 
                    this side project in future endeavours. </p>

                 <h3 class="extra_1_subheading">| Java</h3>
                 <p>Throughout the duration of my Introduction to Software Engineering class, I was tasked 
                     with the group project of implementing an Android application on Android Studio that 
                     exhibits basic functionalities of services offered by an imaginary rental company called 
                     Byblos. 
                     The aforementioned services include car rental, truck rental, boat rental, bike rental, 
                     and moving assistance. Three types of users were created, including the administrator, 
                     customer, and branch employee, all of which had differing functions. </p>
                <p>Throughout the process of implementing the features of this Android application, I 
                    developed and refined many skills in areas such as design specification, production 
                    of UML diagrams, programming using Android Studio, and utilization of GitHub repositories. 
                    Furthermore, this side project also served as the gateway for my experimentation with 
                    databases. Since this project required the storage of data, it was necessary to research 
                    and learn how to push information to and access information from Firebase Realtime Database. 
                    Additionally, Firebase authentication was used to authenticate user login information, 
                    as well as validate user information submitted. Moreover, as this project required the 
                    use of GitHub, I became proficient in utilizing common git commands.  </p>
