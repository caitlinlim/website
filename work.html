                 <p>During my time as a team member at Mad Radish, I developed and refined a multitude 
                     of skills that are transferrable in any workplace environment. </p>
                
                <p>Through daily interaction with numerous customers, I developed excellent interpersonal 
                    skills to satisfy customer needs and resolve complaints. </p>
                
                <p>To ensure that all orders were completed correctly and promptly, I collaborated with 
                    fellow sales team members and developed multitasking skills under difficult work 
                    situations.  </p>
                     
                <p>Moreover, daily tasks such as preparing meal ingredients, assembling customer orders, 
                    and cleaning the premises, were accomplished with efficiency and a positive attitude.</p>
                
                <p> Furthermore, I exhibited adaptability through my gradual proficiency in utilizing 
                    new technologies, including Uber Eats, Foodora, and the Mad Radish ordering service. </p>
                
                <p> I was also given the opportunity to refine my leadership capabilities by performing 
                    managerial tasks during the closing shift, such as calculating daily waste, double-checking 
                    inventory, and shutting down the Mad Radish system. </p>

                <h3 class="extra_2_subheading">Singapore | 2019</h3>
                <p>In 2019, I was blessed with the opportunity to participate as an international intern 
                    in the cardiology department at Changi General Hospital in Singapore. During my time 
                    at this hospital, I was under the tutelage of 4 senior consultant cardiologists and 
                    performed daily tasks, including making ward rounds, interacting with patients, and
                    observing minimally invasive heart surgeries.</p> 
                <p>This experience allowed me to develop highly effective problem-solving skills through 
                    assessing and analyzing unique cardiovascular issues, as well as strengthen existing 
                    communication skills by interacting with over 150 patients a week in daily ward rounds 
                    and cardiac clinics (Private and general cardiac clinics, heart device clinic, heart 
                    failure clinic and police force clinic). </p>   
                <p>Furthermore, I honed my attention to detail skills through observation of surgical procedures 
                    in the operating room, such as device implantation (Pacemakers and defibrillators), 
                    atrial fibrillation ablation, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) ablation, etc. </p>
                <p>My teamwork abilities were once again refined through collaboration with National University 
                    of Singapore medical students to review case studies. </p>
                <p>Finally, I was able to perform bi-weekly observational attachments at the National 
                    Heart Center of Singapore to view electrophysiology procedures of the heart.</p>

                <p>During my time as a volunteer with Ottawa-based family practitioner, Dr. Selwyn De Souza, 
                    I demonstrated attention to detail through the faxing of prescriptions and confidential 
                    health documents for over 200 patients. </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, I exhibited strong organization skills through the careful storage and 
                    management of patient health records and displayed the initiative to learn through 
                    consistent exposure to lessons in overall human health and disease, and appropriate 
                    measures to combat illnesses.

                <p>During the last federal election, my role as a registration officer allowed 
                    me to demonstrate organization and diligence when registering new electors, 
                    correcting information, and completing certificates and declarations. </p>
                <p> Ultimately, professionalism was a major asset in allowing me to interact in a courteous manner with 
                    the public. Furthermore, confidentiality was displayed through receiving and recording personal information from electors.
