                 <p>For the last 4 years, I have dedicated over 200 volunteer hours as a student executive 
                     of the University of Ottawa Healthcare Symposium (UOHS). </p>
                
                <p>From 2018-2019, I acted as 
                    the executive VP Intern, tasked with shadowing the co-chairs and aiding other executives 
                    in accomplishing their tasks. From 2019-2021, my role as VP Sponsorship involved acquiring 
                    over $12,500 from corporate sponsors, including notable healthcare-focused organizations 
                    such as OzTREKK, onboardMD, BEMO Academic Consulting, and RBC. </p>
                
                <p>Each year, a plethora of 
                    prominent speakers, including Dr. Vera Etches, Dr. Gigi Osler, Dr. Brad Bass, captivate 
                    over 200 delegates with their inspiring stories of healthcare and medicine relating to the 
                    annual theme chosen by our executives. </p>
                     
                <p>Ultimately, my dedication to UOHS has allowed me to 
                    share my avid passion for the Canadian healthcare system with my peers. This upcoming year, 
                    I have taken on the new role of VP External Affairs, a position that focuses on liaison between 
                    UOHS and organizations in other universities.</p>

                <p>My passion for self-education of medical management continues with my involvement in the 
                     University of Ottawa Team Diabetes club. </p>
                
                <p>As an individual suffering from a chronic illness, 
                    I sympathize with patients diagnosed with diabetes and I hope to shine a spotlight on the 
                    trials and tribulations of living with a long-term medical condition. </p>     
                
                <p>From 2019-2021, my role as VP Sponsorship has enabled me to interact with a multitude of health-oriented Ottawa 
                    companies, such as Popeyeâ€™s Supplements and Mad Radish, with the purpose of collecting donated 
                    prizes towards the annual Team Diabetes SMASH volleyball tournament. From the latter, all 
                    proceeds are donated to Diabetes Canada. For the 2021-2022 academic year, my position as 
                    VP Marketing will allow me to advertise all Team Diabetes events on social media platforms, 
                    enabling me to accomplish my goal of spreading awareness about diabetes through one of the 
                    most direct methods possible.</p>

                <p>Whilst the majority of my extracurriculars focus on healthcare, I have also made a conscious 
                     effort to invest time into other areas of personal interest. </p>
                     
                <p>Since 2018, I have been an 
                    ardent executive and volunteer tutor of EndoGen Learning at the University of Ottawa. EndoGen 
                    is a student-run non-profit organization that focuses on providing tutoring services to 
                    Ottawa-based high school students in an abundance of subjects. </p>

                <p> Prior to the pandemic, 
                    I accumulated over $400 from approximately 30 hours of tutoring, which constituted a 
                    portion of the proceeds donated to Ottawa-based food charities, such as Dalhousie Food Cupboard.</p>
                
                <p>Ultimately, this experience of aiding younger students seek self-improvement in areas of difficulty 
                    allowed me to discover my passion for helping others pursue success in all areas of academia. </p>
